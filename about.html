          <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
          <p class="bio">At the age of thirteen, I went on a family vacation to Charleston, South Carolina. Walking along the cobblestone streets, I was instantly struck by the beauty of the architecture surrounding me. However, I realized it wasn’t just the elegant aesthetics that made these buildings so intriguing. The interest lay in the fact that they had been part of people’s everyday lives for centuries. The buildings had to be functional as well as beautiful. <span>It is the duality of function and beauty that emcompases good design</span> and intrigues me to this day.</p>
          <img src="images/charleston.png" alt="church steeple">
          <p class="bio">After earning my degree in Historic Preservation from the College of Charleston, I worked at an architectural firm where I researched family histories, and assessed buildings’ eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. My appreciation for design expanded dramatically as I learned about the history of architecture and architectural styles as well as the value of thorough research. I learned how the lives of people shaped the buildings in which they lived, and how as lifestyles changed over time, so did the design of buildings. <span>Good design should be adaptable.</span></p>
          <p class="bio">The next chapter in my life took me to the library field where I could embrace my love of literature and explore graphic design. I created informative library brochures and flyers for programs. During a library website redesign, I was selected as a contributor. Ease of use for library patrons was the primary focus of the project. Users needed to be able to quickly obtain information without wading through irrelevant material.</p>

          <p class="bio">The website redesign experience set my life on a new trajectory. I had always had a love of design and research, and I had finally found a path that would let me embrace both. As a UX/UI designer, <span>I believe good design is not a solitary process. It requires a back and forth dialog between designer, user, and client to achieve the perfect balance between aesthetics and functionality.</span> While my journey to reach this point has been circuitous, my experiences along the way have shaped the designer I am today.</p>

          <p>Originally from Ohio, I now call Phoenix home. In my spare time I enjoy reading, watching classic movies, hiking, and building Legos with my son. If you'd like to know more, please contact me.</p>
