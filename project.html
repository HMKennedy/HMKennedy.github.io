         <h2>Problem</h2>
         <p>Users are increasingly turning to cloud storage as a means of storing and organizing content. However, they often store content in multiple locacation making it difficult to access. Users need an application that allows them to store and organize their documents, notes, and images in one easy to use application which they can access from any device.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="solution">
         <h2>Solution</h2>
         <p>Bevy-a cloud storage application that combines the functionality of Google Drive with the aesthetic appeal of Pinterest. User research guided every aspect of Bevy’s creation from the features included in the app, down to the button design. Bevy allows users to save, share, organize, and create content while employing a design that feels fresh and personal. This is a cloud storage platform users will enjoy using.</p>

         <p>To better understand the cloud storage market, I conducted a competitive analysis of Google Drive, Pinterest, and Shutterfly.</p>
         <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>The ability to share content with others is crucial to users.</li>
           <li>Users need to be able to organize content so it is easy to locate in future.</li>
           <li>Ease of use is of paramount importance. There are a number of cloud storage options, and if users have a trouble navigating one application they will simply switch to another.</li>

User flows were created for onboarding, adding items, existing item options, and account settings.</p>

         <p>During the course of this project, I learned about the importance of user research and testing in guiding your design decisions. Information I gained from the initial user survey aided me through the entire project. Assumptions I made were contradicted by user research and testing, and I realized I would have made wrong turns without this vital information. Change is inevitable in the design process, and it needs to be embraced if you are going to create a successful product.</p>
