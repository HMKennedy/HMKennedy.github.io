       <div class="problem">
         <h2>Problem</h2>
         <p>When children read books within their reading level, they are engaged and challenged rather than bored or frustrated. However, reading levels are not printed on books, so adults have to search the web or make an educated guess as to weather or not a book is in a child’s reading range. In addition, many schools require students to take computerized reading proficency tests. Parents and students need to know what books have available quizes and the quiz point values for the books. </p>
       </div>
       <div class="solution">
         <h2>Solution</h2>
         <p>Book Ferret is an IOS application which allows users to scan or search for a book to discover the book’s reading level, Lexile score, interest level, and quiz program information quickly and easily. User’s have the option of creating individual profiles for multiple children.  Saved profiles can inculde a child's reading level and Lexile score as well as a reading history to help parents remember what books their child has read. Book Ferret also allerts users if a scanned book is in a child's Lexile range. </p>

            <li>The ability to share a book's information page or a user's reading history is crucial.</li>

       <h2 class="heading-lines">User Research</h2>
       <p>I conducted a user survey targeting three groups I identified as potential users for the app: Parents, Teachers, and Librarians. My goals of the survey were to determine who would use the app, what they would use it for, and what features they would find useful. I wanted to know if Lexile was important to users and how widespread the use of online quiz programs were. I also wanted to determine users’ current methods for obtaining information on Lexile levels and quiz programs.</p>
       <div class="bf-stats">
         <h3>Parents</h3>
         <p>Parents used several methods to determine if a book was in their child's reading range. Some flipped through the books and made and educated guess about the reading level. Others had their children read a couple pages to see if it was a good fit, and a few went online to find the Lexile of the book.</p>

         <h3>Teachers</h3>
         <p>To determine the Lexile score of a book, teachers said they either search for the book’s Lexile score online or they level it themselves using established educational guidelines.</p>

         <h3>Librarians</h3>
         <p>Librarians stated they find the Lexile of a book by visiting Amazon or NoveList Plus. To determine if a book is part of a particular quiz program, they have to visit the individual quiz program’s website.</p>

       <div class="wf-tasks">
         <p>I created a prototype in InVision using the low-fidelity wireframes. Wireframe testing allowed me to see if users could navigate the application with minimal visual clues. I conducted three in-person user tests asking testers to complete five tasks.</p>
         <h3>5 Tasks</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>Scan a book</li>
           <li>Create a new user profile</li>
           <li>Add a book to an existing user's reading history</li>
           <li>Search for a book by title</li>
           <li>Share an existing user's reading history via email</li>
         </ul>
         <p>All three testers were able to complete all five tasks. When asked to share a reading history, two testers expected additional screens and where not sure they had completed the task. Based on my user testing I decided to add additional screens to add clarity.</p>

         <p>I created a style guide to give the brand cohesion. The color palette includes navy, orange, yellow, blue, and turquoise which gives the app a vibrant and fun feel. For the brand typeface I wanted to invoke an old fashioned story book and chose Milonga. Because I was creating an IOS app, I wanted a typeface similar to San Francisco and decided on Roboto. I find Roboto clean and easy to read which was of utmost importance.</p>

       <h2 class="heading-lines">High Fidelity Mockups</h2>
       <p>I created high fidelity mockups for the app, incorporating the branding and the feedback from the wireframe testing. I added a short splash screen intro which users have the option to skip. I also redesigned the book information page making it easier to read and scan, and I moved some buttons from the top navigation to the screen content to give them more prominence.</p>

       <p>I was not satisfied with my original splash screen and decided to explore other options. I designed eight splash screen variations and chose my three favorites to put in a preference test. The winning design had 63% of the vote, while the second place design had 31%, and the third had only 6%.</p>

       <p>Based on the user testing results and a design board review, I made several changes to the design mockups. I moved the Save button on the new profile screen to the top right so it is visible without needing to scroll. I moved the Delete button on the profile screen to the top right corner. On the introduction screens, I moved the Skip button to the top right corner, and I changed the bottom navigation bar to a light gray throughout the application. </p>

       <div class="learned-text">
         <p>As the mother of a seven year old, I knew an app of this nature would be helpful to me, but I was unsure if others would find it useful. I was pleased by the overwhelming enthusiasm participants in my user survey had for the app, and the insights I gained in the survey guided the project.</p>
         <p>The most challenging aspect of the project was branding. I did not know what direction I wanted to take the branding, so I really struggled in the beginning. When I finally landed on the idea of Book Ferret, everything fell into place.</p>
         <p>I relied heavily on user testing and comments from a design review board to iterate on my designs making them more intuitive. I realized from the beginning my designs would change and should change. If my final product looked exactly like my initial sketches, I did something wrong.</p>
         <p>If given more time I would have added additional features to the app. I think book reviews and recommendations would be great additional features. An advanced search that allowed users to browse books by Lexile or interest level would be very helpful for adults who are looking for reading materials for children.</p>
